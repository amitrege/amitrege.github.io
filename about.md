Hi! I'm Amit Rege, currently a Masters student in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu). I am interested in building AI which is able to reason about code. 

Before coming to Boulder, I spent 3 fun filled years at [BITS-Pilani, Goa](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). I grew up in the [City of Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) and have lived in [Pune], [Chennai] and [Paris] for varying lengths of time.

Besides computer science, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, cricket, listening to music and thinking about current affairs.
