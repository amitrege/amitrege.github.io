I used the following tutorials to create this site:

[Setting up a basic site]

[Adding MathJax support] 

[Minima Tweaks]

These are pretty straightforward guides which should be enough to get anyone going. This post is meant mainly as a note to myself if I need to go back and look something up in case something breaks.
